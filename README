chownfu - recursively chown user dirs to respective users and config file
===============================================

I work as root often. 
Stuff in /home/username needs to be owned by username.
This can recursively chown stuff to that, depending on what users are found.

By default this looks inside your /etc/chownfu.conf for instructions.
If you use the -u flag, we recursively seek users in /home/* to fix ownerships.
